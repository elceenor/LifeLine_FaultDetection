# LifeLine_FaultDetection
This repository contains the MATLAB and Python code used as a part of Luke Costello's M.S. thesis. The goal of the thesis was to develop a condition monitoring system for deployment on the Cal Poly Wind Turbine. The algorithms were first developed in MATLAB; once their performance was validated, they were ported to Python and integrated on the turbine control system.
